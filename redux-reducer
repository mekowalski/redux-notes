REDUCERS: Specify the application's state changes in response to ACTIONS sent to the STORE
ACTIONS: Only described what happened, but now how the app's state changes

-REDUCER is a pure function that takes in the PreviousState and an ACTION, and returnes the NextState
eg: (previousState, action) => nextState

-It's called a REDUCER because it's a function that would pass to:
 Array.prototype.reducer(reducer, ?initialValue)

-REDUCER should always stay pure
-What should never be inside a REDUCER
  *Mutation of its arguments
  *Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions
  *Call non-pure functions eg: Date.now(), Math.random(), etc
