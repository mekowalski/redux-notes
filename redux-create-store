ENCAPSULATE APPLICATION STATE BY WRAPPING IN A FUNCTION
(Follow along with redux-create-store-v)
-STATE variable defined at the stop of the code holds a representation of all the data needed to display
-Not good practice if variable is Global and can be overwritten

-Solve problem by wrapping STATE into a function
eg:
function() {
  let state
}
