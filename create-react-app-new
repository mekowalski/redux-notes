Create React App is best way to begin building a new React single page application
-It sets up environment to use latest JavaScript features, provides nice developer experience and
optimizes app for productions
-Need Node >= 6 on your machine

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app-name

cd my-app-name
npm start

-Does not handle backend logic or databases, creates frontend build pipeline therefore backend is
entirely on the developer
-Uses Babel and Webpack inder the hood but no configuration
-When ready to deploy, run 'npm run build' to create optimized build of the app in the 'build' folder
