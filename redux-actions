ACTIONS: Payloads of information that send data from the app to the STORE
-The ONLY source of information for the STORE
-Sent using store.dispatch()

-Actions are plain JS objects, that must have a TYPE property indicating the type of action being performed
-TYPES typically are defined as string constants
-Once App is large enough, consider moving TYPES into separate module
eg: import { ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO } from '../actionTypes'

*in the example project, create another action to describe User marking Todo completed alongside ADD_TODO*
