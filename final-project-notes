**Someone mentioned login code is difficult to incorporate with React**
**Also mentioned having 1 or 2 models tops, not trying to upstage previous project**
**Advised keeping app very simple, small and grow it with React**
**If I don't have login info then I may just make it MY OWN RESUME PAGE but that's a bit stagnant**
**I could edit the sections, create new info, delete old info so this may help with state**
**Someone suggested having a public form that users can just use to display their resume info**
**But I think any user would be able to edit resume info that isn't theirs, that is why I want login**
**i don't know, no idea**
