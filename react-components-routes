Web addresses are the backbone of the Internet
-React router is routing library for React allowing links to specific urls
-Components are the heart of React's powerful programming model
-React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application

SETTING UP MAIN ROUTE
-The core app routing lives in the component with React router
*index.js file:*
//imports
//imports

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App/>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

-Now need to install BrowserRouter component as a Router and the Route component into the App component
1. import react-router functions
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route} from 'react-router-dom'

2. Change to have router coordinate what is displayed
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    <Route path='/' component={App}/>
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
)

ADD ADDITIONAL ROUTES
const App = () => {
  return (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <Route exact path="/" render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />
      <Route exact path="/about" render={() => <h1>About</h1>} />
      <Route exact path="/login" render={() =>
        <div>
          <h1>Login</h1>
          <form>
            <div>
              <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
              <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
            </div>
            <div>
              <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
              <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
            </div>
            <input type="submit" value="Login" />
          </form>
        </div>
      } />
    </div>
  </Router>
)}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

-imported the react-router-dom module into the index.js file
-returned the Router component as the top level tag in the JSX return statement
-each route is doing 3 things:
  1. setting a path
  2. passing an arrow function inside a render props to render JSX
  3. setting an exact attribute to explicitly state that you will only see rendered JSX for the specific
  route


COMPONENTS AS PROPS
-The code should be reusable and less brittle
-Move code into small components and inject them into the render prop
-The Route component API has a prop called component and it's more declarative and uses React.createElement
instead of inline JSX injection


NAVLINKS
-React Router API comes with 2 options of adding in Links: <Link> and <NavLink>
