*How to makes this without Auth or Login?*
*Can anyone just come to the site and en1ter beer information and update/delete it?*
*Some beers that are already listed isn't theirs to alter*
*Should I just make a beer site that allows displays of entered beers?*
*This was suggested as a beer finder app, I want to POSSIBLY create a search bar that allows look up
of certain beers by their traits of: Brewery, Type, ABV, Price*
*Use public API to somehow retrieve information on beer after being searched(i don't know how to do
this)*
