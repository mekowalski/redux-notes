Different idea for final project
Previous idea does not meet CRUD requirement

`rails new beer-finder-app` (not sure about name)
database with postgresql to deploy, can i use sqlite3?
remove:jbuilder, turbolinks, coffee-rails
addition to group dev test do: pry, pry-remote, rspec-rails, factory_girl_rails, database_cleaner
addition to group test do: faker, should-matchers(make concise model and association validations)
`bundle install`
configure shoulda-matchers in rails_helper.rb

  -Alcohol % By Volume(ABV)
  -Pint Price
  -Is Seasonal/Regular?
  -Notes

-Beer Name: STRING, REQUIRED
-Brewery Info: STRING, REQUIRED
-Beer Type: STRING, REQUIRED
-ABV: INTEGER, REQUIRED, DEFAULT NOT NULL
-Pint Price: DECIMAL or FLOAT?
-Is Seasonal: BOOLEAN

*Should I just make a beer site that allows displays of entered beers?*
*This was suggested as a beer finder app, I want to POSSIBLY create a search bar that allows look up
of certain beers by their traits of: *
*Use public API to somehow retrieve information on beer after being searched(i don't know how to do
this)*
*If it's a beer finder app and I use data keys provided by public api, then it will just inform the
user about the beer, display beer info. How do I use that data to modify and meet CRUD reqs?*
*Suggestion of using rails API*
*Assuming routes as `/beer/:beer_id` instead of `/api/beer/:beer_id`*
*somehow work with coordinates or an address??*
*need to persist data. how do i use a public api and save that info to my rails api?*
*could i input random beer info and save that to the database?*
*but then what help is the database i have if it's a beer finder app and users are supposed to
be able to see beer data that's from the public api database? i am so confused*
*how to create a form and submit and persist data*
*if a database is being used, how would i save a keyword in the search? what would i use that
persisted data for?*
*use Faker gem to play with dummy data. Faker::Beer*

//with help
*model would be a search, attribute would be a keyword*
  model SEARCH: query string, STRING
       : type, STRING
       validate with options of beer type, brewery name or all

*multiple kinds of searches*
-location, beer type, brewery name(location not included in the GET: /search endpoint)
-the BreweryDB site has many options for endpoints but thinking of just using search for the main
model with 2 attributes
-save all the searches input
-use that save to form api requests
-have views to look for previous searches and display those results
-store query string and type


-Beer app needs to be able to input information
-Can index all the beers, certain beers by attributes
-Can display show page of a single beer
-Ability to update any beer you entered
-Ability to delete any beer you entered
-Create a new beer in form
-Read/Review the new beer
-Update the beer that was made
-Delete beer if needed


RESTful routes
/beer/ ---> index
/beer/new ---> new
/beer ---> create
/beer/:beer_id ---> show, update, destroy
/beer/:beer_id/edit ---> edit


[i wanted to work today but i became so overwhelmed with everything.  i couldn't focus, i tried
watching some programming and ten minutes was too long.  i tried to read up on 'create-react-app'
and it seemed to be another language.  at some point i went on so many rabbit holes that i ended
up reading an article about how coding is politically involved and is working on changing
dynamic relationships for everyone to have(it was intriguing).  i'm still reviewing so much React
and redux because i still am not 100% competent to program in that library or container.  i
noticed that i spent almost a month just reading, reviewing, worrying and aimlessly learning to
program.  instead i realized, after a meet and help with another experienced programmer, that i
haven't tried being adventurous and haven't thought of the project as a fun game, challenge.  this
is what i am going to do now.  i'm going to ask tons of questions, i'm not going to fear code,
i will build a fun application, my project may take a moment to be but it will come to be.  because
this all is at my pace, my race, my rules.]

[020518: i had a meet with a student/friend and we discussed all sorts of topics from personal life
to coding to job hunting, project mode and project challenges, husbands and the places we live.  it
was great just catching up with a fellow student/friend/programmer who is on a similar path as i
am on in life and career]

[020718: today i just read articles and things i could find online about JavaScript mainly.  i want
to refresh myself with that.  i also tried to watch a few videos i bookmarked but i couldn't focus
on them at all.  i really could not sit and listen to them, they were a bit boring so i just read
instead]

[020817: instead of coding, i read a new book i just began a few days ago.  also i became fascinated
watching eddie woo math videos.  it may be helpful and help me want to actually code.]

[021318: i didn't code again but i searched for jobs all day, some nearby, most of the jobs were
elsewhere.  i know i need to finish this project because i'm so close to graduating, it's tough.
met with a student again this morning and discussed some bootstrap and html code.]

[021418: came across a bookmark i had and reviewed a ton of react with rails (rails 5) integration.
i think this is going to help me with my project a ton!  i'm actually stoked about react. it's kind
of a side step that i'm taking but if it excites me, will help me with my project and help me
understand react then it's kind of necessary.]

[022018: did more review for react and redux. didn't touch my project today]
