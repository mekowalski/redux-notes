Different idea for final project
Previous idea does not meet CRUD requirement

`rails new beer-finder-app` (not sure about name)
database with postgresql to deploy, can i use sqlite3?
remove:jbuilder, turbolinks, coffee-rails
addition to group dev test do: pry, pry-remote, rspec-rails, factory_girl_rails, database_cleaner
addition to group test do: faker, should-matchers(make concise model and association validations)
`bundle install`
configure shoulda-matchers in rails_helper.rb

*How to makes this without Auth or Login?*
*Can anyone just come to the site and en1ter beer information and update/delete it?*
*Some beers that are already listed isn't theirs to alter*
*Should I just make a beer site that allows displays of entered beers?*
*This was suggested as a beer finder app, I want to POSSIBLY create a search bar that allows look up
of certain beers by their traits of: Brewery, Type, ABV, Price*
*Use public API to somehow retrieve information on beer after being searched(i don't know how to do
this)*
*If it's a beer finder app and I use data keys provided by public api, then it will just inform the
user about the beer, display beer info. How do I use that data to modify and meet CRUD reqs?*
*Suggestion of using rails API*
*Assuming routes as `/beer/:beer_id` instead of `/api/beer/:beer_id`*
*somehow work with coordinates or an address??*
*Build with test approach?*
*need to persist data. how do i use a public api and save that info to my rails api?*
*could i input random beer info and save that to the database?*
*but then what help is the database i have if it's a beer finder app and users are supposed to
be able to see beer data that's from the public api database? i am so confused*
*email regarding use of public api without creating account*
*how to create a form and submit and persist data*
*if a database is being used, how would i save a keyword in the search? what would i use that
persisted data for?*
