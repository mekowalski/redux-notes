I committed code on Github for 62 days, I wanted to go for 75 days but it didn't happen & I was close
-Elaborate on these
-Some things I learned and did during the coding streak:

-Began Hacktoberfest contribution on a Github user's repository
  I had not contributed to Hacktoberfest until October 2017. I recall the event and legitimately I
  had already met the requirements of getting a Hactobkerfest t-shirt by a long shot but I wanted to
  actually use my skills and make a contribution.  I found a few Hacktoberfest projects on the site
  and picked one that I believed I could contribute open-source code on.  This was a great new branch
  of coding I had done and broke up the daily learning I had done during the time.  Instead of learning
  I was using what I learned to contribute in the programming community.

-Made my own project for Hacktoberfest for beginners to contribute to
  In the month of Octoberfest, Github and Digital Ocean sponsor a month long coding, contributing,
  programming event to get people involved in open source.  I was inspired and decided to create
  a small project where newer coders can fork, clone and contribute a profile of themselves and a
  'Hello World' script in their favorite language.  This was great for me because I was also able to
  learn simple Github tasks of how to merge pull requests, write notes to other programmers and use
  tags.

-Began Codewars challenges more, mainly with building JavaScript algorithms

-Began learning an immense amount of React

-Learned about Props and State and how to differentiate the two

-Learned how to build Components

-Learned another mass amount of Redux

-Learned the usage of Webpacks, Babel and JSX

-Learned about React CRUD(it seems each stack has its own version of crud and rest)
