I committed code on Github for 62 days, I wanted to go for 75 days but it didn't happen and I was close
Some things I learned and did during the coding streak

-Began Hacktoberfest contribution on a Github user's repository
-Made my own prject for Hacktoberfest for beginners to contribute to
-Began Codewars challenges more, mainly with building JavaScript algorithms
-Began learning an immense amount of React
-Learned about Props and State and how to differentiate the two
-Learned how to build Components
-Learned another mass amount of Redux
-Learned the usage of Webpacks, Babel and JSX
-Learned about React CRUD(it seems each stack has its own version of crud and rest)
